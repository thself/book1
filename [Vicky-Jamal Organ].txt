[Vicky-Jamal Organ]
\Trajectory
I’ve been more interested in what Vicky has to say about me, has been saying about me and generally thinks about what I’ve said to her, because she’s shown concern in me.

My relationship with Vicky represents my ability to access and express the appreciation I have for what I have made sense of in my life.

Vicky wants life to get worse for some people but can’t see how it affects her because the worst thing that’s happened is that she stopped having faith in me.
I got to know and appreciate Vicky through supporting all of the females that displayed an honest understanding of their environment and subsequently acknowledged my existence in accordance with my most beneficial aspirations for the people that shared the community with us but were not in anyway influencing how we were developing our relationships.
Vicky won’t accept that I care for her when she thinks that she can change how others feel about her.

No one can stop, change or influence the development of organs in someone without explicit, literal or entitled explanation provided by myself and Vicky.
The Vicky-Jamal organ mediates the development and degeneration of organs through giving and taking responsibility for the immune responses produced in the vessels supporting the organs.
The Vicky-Jamal organ moderates the sense of an organ by determining how the host feels about, desires, can handle and enjoys putting together or integrating the image of organ into their self image, recognisable body, understanding of the community and imagination or exaggerated sense of authority and pleasure.

The vessels give rise to the organs as the cells do to the vessels, working together to invalidate their limitations and produce the same affect though simpler means. Similarly organelles that make up cells are given rise to from molecules like DNA, protein and oxygen as the particles (atomic to elementary) do to the molecules.
The Vicky-Jamal organ utilises pain, fatigue and excitations such as mania or hyperactivity by creating means for supporting structure for the sense of influence in you environment allowing the confusing experiences to represent the target, which is sensed, of the immune response needed in the organs believed most likely to be under the greatest stress in the situation being heeled.
The expendability of vessels leads to fatalities in retarded scum as they insist in every situation that their organs work in a different way, if not with more or less activity they are considered as being nurtured uniquely, but contrarily want their cells to have little to no expendability and this is compensated by creating stress whenever a cell dies giving them the sense that they cannot influence their cellular structure where this mistaken understanding is actually the sense of vision overlaid with amazement or vulnerability, seeing something being dominated or being observed.

The Vicky-Jamal organ operates during sleep or the dream state as the means to which feelings are temporarily, arbitrarily and insignificantly changed in order to sense the target of failed immune responses produced in the waking state or everyday life.
The Vicky-Jamal organ reduces the excitation, excitement and excretion created when an immune response fails to take responsibility, converting in a useful form or invalidating the affects, of it’s sensed target.
Wanting to be forgiving of someone or expressing forgiveness suggests that you have failed to reject a development in your immune system and subsequently decided to act in a way that exposes you to an environment that suppressed your immune responses.

Feeling like you need, forgot or struggle to write something down creates the sense that your ideas cannot be analysed for it’s effectiveness, self-critical nature and developmental potential. 
To want to measure how effective some retarded scum are at retarding the community or how potent your bleach is provides the means for the Vicky-Jamal organ to create the sense of what physical properties of bleach, a completely successful immune response or a understanding that excludes the necessity for acknowledging what ways, activities or realities they desire to be retarded, provoked and observed in.
Patients and hospitals represent the fight and flight response in regards to the Vicky-Jamal organ requiring the sense of a ritual or presentation of the relations of a container to its contents, a server to it’s employer or a perspective to its council in order to produce geometries for someone that create a completely successful immune response to a given opportunity that has been rejected and therefore overwhelming or incompletely handled and therefore attractive.

Immune responses occur telekinetically, produced for the sake of one individual at the expense of another, to the extent that two or more people share opposite, contrasting or complementary symptoms of hysteria which can be sensed as the wounds or byproducts of conflict, confiding in each other or rejecting similar opportunities.
Habits are mistaken for reactions when the telepathic connections someone has made create reasons for rejecting opportunities, the development of senses and the Vicky-Jamal organ’s function of maintaining the order of expressions that utilise all of a person’s structure, sensory, immunological and motor in a way to allow all of these expressions to be expressed in a repeating sequence.
The developing and degenerating function of the Vicky-Jamal organ is mistaken for supporting your organs when your body is viewed as being able to telekinetically influence a telepathic connection rather than people’s  sense of telepathy being dependent of the quantity and quality of someone they have made a connection with, which is especially affected by the amount of retarded scum associated with compared to people who develop or heel the community by applying potent bleach.

Retarded scum do not live independently and have their primary affects of retardation in groups that contain some individuals that produce bleach, in order to ensure the individual does not, through individuation, make their bleach potent. The Vicky-Jamal organ can function to not only detect when some retarded scum develops their retardation responsibility but allows someone to reject the opportunity to acknowledge, influence or do anything but oppress and suppress the emotions of people who have been affected by the newly developed retardation.
Retarded scum cannot affect anyone other than other retarded scum, this is represented in the structure of the Vicky-Jamal organ as the senses it creates allow someone to locate, localise or protect their understanding of themselves in regards to how they feel, what organs they sense frequently and rarely and why they are feeling a certain way about their environment. This is similar to the Vicky-Jamal organ’s function to process the interpretations someone has for people in their life that treat them negatively, discouraging their aspirations or persuading them to participate in retardation, as containing, cultivating and misunderstanding the sensed target of the immune responses that previously were complete and are now incomplete, immune responses with the potential to develop into completion or immune responses that are complete and have the responsibility of creating new opportunities to develop more immune responses.

Bleach can be seen as the superimposition of a person’s understanding, process or image of individuation onto some retarded scum; it can also be the conscious censorship of some retarded scum’s process of retardation. The potency of bleach can be measured through interpretations of how one person’s original superimposition is repeated, successfully or not, the original use represents the foundational product, typical interaction and generative principle where retarded scum can only influence the generative principle through retardation which can be repurposed to prevent other retarded scum from participating in this way as retarded scum can prevent the mutual generating needed to form group activities. Therefore bleach potency increases through applying a conscious suggestion of why you personally believe some people are retarded scum but are nevertheless irrelevant, uninteresting and self-sacrificing allowing interpretations of the foundational product (and whoever you produced it with) to be applied to everything and everyone in your environment.
The Vicky-Jamal organ materialises upon the sensory neurones found through the body, manifesting intersections between sensors and therefore appears to be weaving, fusing or moving senses together with it’s supporting (motor and immunological) structure but only sense it’s affect on other organs, function on interpretations of what the individual is doing and responsibilities on the environment in terms of maintaining a distinction in attraction between the familiar and unfamiliar understandings where those participating in retardation are attracted to the unfamiliar and individuation creates attraction to the familiar.
The Vicky-Jamal organ develops organs that are believed to be under the most stress whilst they are participating in individuation, the extent that an organ degenerates at this time depends on what someone thinks about how the community treats their environment where imagining people destroying, protecting or being overwhelmed by the environment will lead to organ degeneration if they’re not believed in.

To presume everyone can develop or already has the Vicky-Jamal organ suggests you mistook some retarded scum’s claims for what they think or believe. This mistake represents the function of the Vicky-Jamal organ to present familiar understandings of a sense as empty, negative or controlling in order to encourage the individual to participate in individuation through developing, tending to and changing the way they interpret their reaction to the briefly altered appearance. The people without the Vicky-Jamal organ can be seen as retarded scum to the extent that they desire to change the way something is appearing,how it appears to happen or has happened.
Believing you are addicted to an activity or emotionally obsessed and worshipful of a person creates ideas about television that program into someone the sense of awkwardness, uncomfortableness or anxiety when people begin or encourage someone to interpret what they’re feeling about the community. 
Feeling comfortable represents the Vicky-Jamal organ’s function to develop its supporting structure after having this be sensed as the environment, as in the apparent objects and activities, whilst rewarding someone that is attempting to interpret what they see as negative and also believes there’s more positive experiences in their community than otherwise with the sense of the manageability, sensibility and mobility in the impressions they have of activities they regularly or enthusiastically partake in.

To think someone is repeating themselves represents the Vicky-Jamal organ’s function to provide the sense of interaction, which is experience as a familiar feeling about what you’re doing, where the sense of a developing or degenerating organ has been rejected. 
To believe a person is making a claim suggests an attraction to the experience of having someone change the way they think. This represents the Vicky-Jamal organ’s function of reorganising, intensifying and displaying an individual’s sense of understanding, of themselves or the community, in every sense’s form as the Vicky-Jamal organ is only able to develop when it is founded upon all of someone’s senses.
To be concerned, trying to change or overwhelmed and antagonising memories of what you thought, about yourself or the community, suggests the Vicky-Jamal organ has started developing, for the first time or just a new generation and segment of it, it’s supporting structure; the sense someone gets about this process depends on what organ they believe is put under the most stress when they are behaving sensibly, assertively or passively, this means they’ll feel as if the organ is abnormally energetic to the extent that the Vicky-Jamal organ is beginning to develop new supporting structure.

Thinking that your brain is the most stressed organ in an activity, requiring more resources under certain conditions or allows someone to process intelligence and behave sensibly creates the idea that your organs do not have any independence so they cannot act harmoniously. This represents the function of the Vicky-Jamal organ which simultaneously develops all organs at once as it requires a immune response that is consistently completely successful throughout your body, provides understandings of how senses can be used to give people insight into your perspective of them in the community because it has a complementary shape relative to your other organs and reduces certainty or the sense of control to a quality of sensations where organ’s that rarely are considered the most stressed organ under any conditions (e.g. bones) are actually parts of the body where the person most often rejects development pathways.
Believing your mouth, face or tongue and therefore speech, tone and facial expressions are the most stressed organs and functions in some situations suggests you have been convinced by some retarded scum that your formula for bleach does not agree with, creates conflict in or damages the health of who you created your foundational product with; this allowing them to encourage people to participate in retardation because they can claim that your bleach, with its interpretations of their effect of the community, has motivated them to do so as they’re impressed by the fact they want to change their value of you apparently to avoid harm to themselves or others but literally because the only way retarded scum interact with the community is through retardation.
To feel like your genitals are the most stressed organ in some activities creates the idea that authority does not enjoy the way you think or what you believe in. This represents the function of the Vicky-Jamal organ where it allows organs someone rejects least to be sensed in a way that makes the host imagine the organ as if it had a life of it’s own, this anthropomorphism allows all organs to be accepted or rejected less as the Vicky-Jamal organ provides the positive sensations from this imagination to some part of every organ.
The belief that a hosts self-awareness is experiencing, observing or involving more stressful sensations that this hosts awareness of things outside of their awareness of their own body (self-awareness) including other entities bodies represents a period of a greater frequency of rejection of development pathways for the Vicky-Jamal Organ, reducing the hosts sense of what’s happening outside of their body.

Claiming your hips, thighs or butt are the most stressed areas of your body in some situations creates the idea that the appearances you believe you prefer can only be claimed to be the opposite when you desire to share them with people as your understanding of the community is believed to be at risk, degenerated or censoring other people with ideas you’d enjoy because you have had more experiences of communicating to retarded scum that they are not participating in a process of retardation and that if they were you would be also therefore what they are doing is unique and not a deceptive imitation of the ways that you show your appreciation of the community to those you’ve choose to attempt to make a foundational product, I.e. bleach, with.
Freezing someone absolves you from the responsibility, desire or healing sense associated to sleep. This represents the function of the Vicky-Jamal organ to reduce the energy, understanding or penetration of the respiratory system into the health and utility of the blood through producing completely successful immune responses which can process any chemical element received and displayed upon sense organs supporting the visual function of dreaming, I.e. resting your eyes, and compliment the telekinetic function of sleeping, which can be seen as dreaming and its effect on the individual, as the Vicky-Jamal organ develops the harmony of the organs through having the sense of them be: irrelevant, as dreams are felt as unreal; fantastic, as each dreams occurs in a way completely unique to the individual’s perspective at the time and non-invasive, as the individual imagines they were not doing anything whilst sleeping regardless of imaginations.
To develop your responsibility to freeze your community attempt to create an entertaining sense of the parts of your body that are believed to be under the least stress without producing a need to make the parts of your body under the most stress less entertaining, focused on or important.

Freezing people is different from applying bleach to them as it does not provide interpretations of some retarded scum’s effect on the community, rather it is likely to encourage or expose retarded scum to participate more enthusiastically in a process of retardation. Nevertheless it encourages people to individuate, possibly providing insight into how to form a foundational product, what their generative principle is and why they’re able to develop the typical interaction. This represent the Vicky-Jamal organ’s function of degenerating senses in order to provide: higher quality; more comfortable speeds representing change in; less abrupt terminations of what’s displayed or understood and more easily analysable rewards or reactions to responsibilities of senses later  on as the sense of the Vicky-Jamal organ is felt as more significant as it approaches its end and becomes supporting structure to which a new sense is necessary.
The Vicky-Jamal organ provides the sense of dependency, that you need to associate with someone to get the sense of something, on parts of the body where a completely successful immune response is represented as a rejection of feeling or sensation in order to function as a baseline or natural feeling for when someone is free to interpret the situation they’re in. This represents the Vicky-Jamal organ’s function of reducing movements of an organ to allow less mobile organs to receive the same sense as the more flexible ones, e.g. bones and muscles or chest and legs (less and more respectively), where the Vicky-Jamal organ gets more able to provide this sense as the need for more supporting structure is required and the sensors become this supporting structure which the newly formed sense is more easily applied in varying ways onto the organs as it must determine what organs need developing and degenerating.
Thinking that you are trying to blame someone or looking for something wrong suggests an incomplete immune response is coming close to completion and the negatively view object, situation or idea represents the senses target that will be completely destroyed if you accept that you have a way of handling, therefore making use of, whatever you’re blaming. This shows that the Vicky-Jamal organ functions to change the sense someone has of an organ to force them to express things that will expose their feelings for the community to those they’re interacting with by exaggerating their imagination of how capable, sensible or relatable someone can be when their organs are not working in harmony meaning their body isn’t harmonious and the person is likely maintaining or initiating a process of retardation.

You can have immune responses which successfully enable you to freeze your community but do not exclude yourself due to the desire to learn more about who in your community is benefiting from the freeze more than others and what you should expect from people after they have been froze, even if you are too, but especially if you’re not. The incompleteness of this immune response can be attributed to the function of the Vicky-Jamal organ where when a sense of enjoyment, overwhelming or comforting, suppresses the immune system and therefore the development of the organs in the area, the Vicky-Jamal organ provides a sense of confusion with a completely successful immune response, such as resisting a irritation, in order to provide the host an opportunity to understand that their happiness is not dependent on a finding pleasurable circumstance but a satisfying reaction to situations, i.e. enjoying the rewards that last for a long time and enjoying less those pleasures that are short lasting.
Feeling like forgiving people can limit your responsibility of freezing people because being a freezer requires you to provide a certain feeling about how people are interacting with the community which ignores behaviour that is promised, troublesome or hypothetical and has not actually occurred yet. To be attracted to creating uncertainty for someone can improve your understanding in how you are able to freeze those in your environment. This can be due to an understanding of attraction that makes you think your life will get better if you allow yourself to be attracted, if you reach the goal you’re attracted to or if you learn something about your community on the way to fulfilling and stopping your attractive behaviours; all of this understanding of attraction represents the Vicky-Jamal organ’s function of varying the sense of the organ itself across the body, producing more a pleasurable or important sense where there’s organ is most frequently believed to be developing (possibly the brain or muscles) and less so where this belief has little to no consideration so therefore can be known as degenerating, and when the sense is repurposed as supporting structure the inverted sense is produced to promote further development in the Vicky-Jamal organ (so there will be greatest pleasure in the areas believed to be unable to develop).
Doubting your ability to freeze represents a desire to have your ideal function as you believe an organ does, with a purpose that takes into account those around it, as if it is an organ, function, service or responsibility of your authorities. The Vicky-Jamal organ provides your immune system with the means to develop the other organs according to their limitations due to their geometric structure and relations to each other, which means whatever desires you do not have a sense of reduce the amount your organs can develop and similarly degenerate your organs when you reject the opportunity to acknowledge or begin to satisfy your desires.

Initiating a freeze allows someone to acknowledge the sense they have of the influence in their environment, a form of stimulation that is freely willed to fulfil a purpose that will be long lasting and included in everyone’s development in the community or the dominant suggestions that most people believe are physically impossible and unobtainable because of the understanding of moral, aesthetic and literal systems being produced for everyone’s benefit as well as pleasure (rather than benefiting or pleasuring them therefore leaving them desiring to develop the system in order to gain a more satisfying benefit and pleasure or more frequently alternating 
(that means benefits and pleasures are given closer together)).
To think your emotions or thoughts lead to, or encourage, your actions to prevent you from understanding when you will be able to freeze your community compensating for the desires to behave in a way that limits the behaviour of those in your community through expending your energy, withdrawing qualities or sensations from your ideal (suggesting some sense’s are understood as not ideal) and trying to make them forget about the influence they know you have over them (which can include wanting them to completely understand the influence you have over them). This allows the person you’re interacting with to determine your behaviour to the extent that they understand how you relate, enjoy or are overwhelmed by a certain part of the community. On the other hand, allowing someone to believe they’ve incorrectly interpreted your experience of a situation provides you with the means to freeze them on command as this manipulation repurposed their supporting structure and senses (i.e. their whole body) as a sense of your own which is supported by your Vicky-Jamal organ as the places in your environment where the Vicky-Jamal organ develops (by repurposing it’s sense of your organs into supporting structure) can be seen as leaving markers or anchoring the Vicky-Jamal organ itself, separate from your body, in the area; this is evident by the appreciation that someone has for a place that allows them to express their complete emotional range or reality.
The Vicky-Jamal organ primarily functions to facilitate the expression to a new telepathic connection (an individual) of the nature of your responsibility to use telepathy. This is developed with an understanding of your senses, which are felt, the supporting structure of your body, which organises (with motor neurones) and protects (with the lymphatic system) your senses. To believe your Vicky-Jamal organ is more external than the other organs suggests you’re attached to memories, or the experience of, avoiding an appearance; this creates the sense of a lack of understanding, existence or pleasure when the avoided experience potential or actually has appeared. On the other hand, appealing or appreciating people who do not avoid this appearance creates the sense of being overwhelmed or controlled when this person appears in your experience which can be seen negatively to the extent that you do not acknowledge that all of your senses are willed or managed through how you feel, about yourself and the community.

My Vicky girls don’t look like they’re doing anything to represent me, the discovery of the Vicky-Jamal organ to the theory of Passionate Attraction and the Pope’s reality, yet they look like all the people that I wish could support by representing me more.
When ever something feels like it isn’t doing something it should be the Vicky-Jamal organ is processing production and consumption demands from sensory experience in order to modulate their effectiveness with its supporting structure.

A homosexual is anyone other than your significant other.
The Vicky-Jamal organ is functioning to connect any two parts of the host’s body with any two memories of the host’s body, providing a sensory experience of what the host remembers.
We are always talking about two or more disciplines, disciplinary actions or at least a single known discipline and whilst representing the common indication of a person lacking in ability to subject themselves to a single discipline, which can be related to the nature of the Vicky-Jamal Organ. Here the sense of the organ can be provided more confidently, confidentially or personally where the sense of it oscillating is comforting rather than painful, this takes into account the notion someone would not want to relive painful experiences and would rather experience comfortable sensations.
It’s the sensations that you associate most with having your flesh ripped from outside of your body that are most comforting when associated with the Vicky-Jamal Organ.

The oscillating function or appearance of the Vicky-Jamal organ justifies it in being made up of the sensory receptors throughout  the body. This is because what oscillates is the sensations of the host’s body, whereas if it was not the sensations of the host’s body which they felt were moving about their biological supporting structure then it would be the result of a particular sensory receptor and it’s relationship with the environment.
The oscillating of the Vicky-Jamal Organ resembles pain reception inasmuch as it simulate movements which compensate for the potentiality, sensation or force a pain my create, provide or suggest to a host.

It being about this one year, and it not really happening, but when I think back and still or want to be with the resultant product of the Vicky-Jamal Organ. 
When considering the Vicky-Jamal Organ, the most recent experiences, impressions or sensations are most relevant to the greatest amount of known people, things or individuals where the most personally relevant phenomena are most difficult to conceive by the host via the Vicky-Jamal Organ.

\Journey
When I decided that I was unfaithful in romance, and that this necessarily meant or at least would cause unfaithfulness platonically, because of my lack of appreciation for intelligence.
When I decided to have a so-called ice cold cup of water, as a youth I determined that it provided me with a strange pleasure if I wanted to feel such a way about drinking. As I have aged it is evident that my body reacts to the physical coldness of water with a sensation of heat, it would be strange if youth I know could accept this ability of the body to produce heat without organic knowledge of the Vicky-Jamal Organ, and obviously, better yet truthfully, no one in the world can communicate this to youth.

When I feel someone has committed sufficiently to the development of my own sensory processes mediated by the Vicky-Jamal Organ, as every organ has the potential to suffice amongst one’s ability to conceptualise others, 


/journey
Because I convince Vicky to have sex with me I could also feel like she was dominating me in a way that was linguistically programming her to latter feel nervous if I could dominate her, much like the theory of Charles Fourier.

Vicky was too busy and happy hating God when she told me she was “Scared”.

As I caught Vicky intimately in a situation where she was most unconscious, taking the opportunity to beforehand be conscious of the potential of that day, I had her faith in me as her memory, as biologically it’s dependencies from birth have been as to me.

In all honesty the Vicky situation went much better than expected unto it’s much speedier completion at the blockage suddenly suggesting what could have only been expressed through these years of avoidance on Vicky’s part to suggest that she hates me.
Thankfully Queen Elizabeth prepared me in her nation with Victoria, where I was later shown the prevalence of my theorisations in Victoria, Australia; after an introductory course it was evident that I was better prepared than any student they’ve ever had in learning about violence against women and aboriginal women. This was even due to the constant repetition of the name Victoria and Vicky as I was picking her up.

I had shown Vicky the way to overcome Satan, no one would give her anything better and I noticed sooner than her.
