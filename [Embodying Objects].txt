[Embodying Objects]

They talk to the public as if it has the responsibility to them to be mutually beneficial,  I.e. as if everything in the community is as inspirational as the people they appreciate.
They prevent people they live with from understanding how difficult it is to cooperate with them by talking about people they don’t put up with.
Someone stops others from appreciating what they want, therefore wasting their appreciation on underserved things, when they imagine being valued or used more than things in the environment of some appreciated object, I.e. they have a aura or forcefield which deflects appreciation away from their locality.
Lead Sentinelese people, their tribal appearance is an indication of the conditions of people surrounding them, they are in this case Embodying Objects and it can be seen that the appreciation or lack thereof of these people reflect, effect and manage sensations which are personally relevant.
To direct or lead is to resolve subject-object relations, these are the focal point of embodying objects which allow the range of possibilities conceived to be charged positively or negative. This means outside of the focal point positivity and negativity become forms of neutrality.

Sin necessarily prevents movement, change or energetic spin, this prevents Embodying Objects from producing a lapse or failure in memory which results from assessing things or yourself as objectively negative. Here it is evident any action or behaviour without influence of sin has a redemptive effect on the actor’s memory.
Taking objects out of their subjective context, or subjecting people to objects outside of their context is a sinful way of Embodying Objects. 
All knowledge arises, becomes, creates to make discontent the source of sin, this is evident by the appearance of death that proceeds sin which amplifies errors of those who witness it.
