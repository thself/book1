Biofilm: Guassian Function = This integral is 1 if and only if {\textstyle a={\tfrac {1}{c{\sqrt {2\pi }}}}} (the normalizing constant), and in this case the Gaussian is the probability density function of a normally distributed random variable with expected value μ = b and variance σ2 = c2: {\displaystyle g(x)={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}\exp \left({\frac { (x-\mu )^{2}}{2\sigma ^{2}}}\right).} AKA Niffy & Rig Veda girl that I also liked
