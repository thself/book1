To freeze is freeing to the extent that the opportunities someone can take, the states they believe they can be or the activities they consider as changing them, provide a sense of certainty that only they can influence and that is consistent with their environment inasmuch as the nature, responsibilities and structure of their life.
Making yourself or the community freeze can be considered as providing freedom, freeing or stopping them from doing anything (as in deciding to do a particular thing, rather than being open to everything for example) as long as the freezer considers those who it will freeze (it’s contents) where it at least provides entertainment and at most stress.
The community has the sense of entertaining the pope, when the sense degenerates they presume they are stressing the pope. As the whole community has the sense, the pope and his subjects are able to retaliate, this is similar to someone feeling stressed with themselves with the according affects of stress on performance, intelligence and attention which can still occur when someone looks for entertainment when they are stressed, prefers entertainment to stress or believes a situation is stressful because they cannot see anything entertaining about it.
Claiming your sense of control, influence in the community and overall experience of life can’t be expressed in the words you write provides a lack of understanding where, if someone freezes you or makes you speechless, you would immediately begin to imagine what it would be like if it were you doing the freezing rather than the person who froze you.

People try to deceive others, lie about when they’ve been frozen or speechless and suggest they have knowledge about what a community’s purpose is to be able to claim they have completely successful immune responses, when in reality they are suppressing their immune system, and therefore can feel positively about interactions with people they do not know, care about or can imagine in their ideal situations.
Relating thoughts and circumstances together suggests that someone has the desire to freeze their perception of the community, the individuals in their community and the development of their community. This represents the function of the Vicky-Jamal organ to provide a sense of dependency or uncomfortableness at an organ that is, because of the sensations it has, reducing the chance that the other organs have to receive, cultivate and imagine the ways it can be understood as a significant part of someone’s bodies vitality.
To mistake abnormal feelings for negativity suggests you doubt you’re able to freeze anyone in your community, and that this doubt is supported by a worry or belief that freezing only can be negative because it not only creates a chain reaction but exposes retarded scum because they’ll respond to the freezing, or freeing feelings, with claims about how their life is getting worse because of the activities that are most freeing for the community.

Freezing can have the opposite effects to freeing some retarded scum if: they’ve successfully reduced the potency of the person’s (freezer) bleach, therefore the reality of this person’s relationship with whoever they made their foundational product with as well; provide means for the person with the responsibility to freeze to neglect incomplete immune responses, reacting negatively to their complete immune responses, or are able to freeze themselves prior to bleach being applied to them, making their response to the typical interaction unconscious whilst retarding the generative principle meaning they’ll be encouraged to participate in a process of retardation, pretending that they’re impressed or unaware of why some people around them have been able to individuate.
Being unaware of when you’re making claims, feeling like you’re constantly making claims or thinking about how you can explain something that you remember happened suggests that you have been rejecting the sense of the supporting structure of those you have either made a foundational product with, accepted your foundational product or seen provides others with the means to create a foundational product therefore will not be able to develop the product without accepting their initial impression would incorrectly suggest they are more intimately attached, informed or giving support by one person who made the foundational product than the other. This leads to values of some retarded scum that reduce the sense of the Vicky-Jamal organ by encouraging the sense of rejection to develop on every organ preventing senses from being repurposed as supporting structure as the sense of your organs working harmoniously will be rejected and any intentions to freeze will be treated as attempts to reject what you sense from your environment.
Freezing without freezing yourself can occur if your Vicky-Jamal organ has developed, from its function of altering the pleasure of a sense to stimulate understandings of how the hosts’ organs work harmoniously, the responsibility of the visual sense to the extent that whatever is apparent represents the influence of the host on the object, the intentions of the host for a subject and the relationship an individual has with the community.

Freezing appears to create doubts in order to give the freezer an understanding of how they’ve mistaken their body for intentional feelings. This represents the Vicky-Jamal organ’s function of producing the sense of a search, pursuit or persuasion on the areas of the Vicky-Jamal organ where they’re not attached to other organs but exposed directly to the others things in the environment, the extent that this searching sense is produced is determined by how much the individual is rejecting the development of their organs, believes organs can function to sense some retarded scum (rather than it being a function of your understanding or application of what you sense) or believes something should be happening regardless of whether they feel like it should be.
The dislike of your habits or the resistance to them can be attributed to a desire to freeze those who participate in the activities that your habit includes. This can discourage you from freezing if you believe worrying, appealing or ignoring your impressions prevents you from expressing what you’ve been impressed by, therefore what you’ve learned from your experience of life, because the community responds to your behaviour by changing your senses (rather than using your understanding of your senses to change the environment). This represents the Vicky-Jamal organ’s function to develop its supporting structure in a way that encourages the host to desire to experience more of their community, create new interpretations of their environment and share more of their understanding with those they care for. This is done by the Vicky-Jamal organ forming complementary to how the sensory receptors are distributed throughout the body, ignoring the supporting motor and immunological receptors, creating a sense of harmony that does not rely on all of the organs being sensed or understood in the same way, working towards the same goal and having the same importance however organs do get more responsibility to prevent other organs from failing because as much as an immune response is successful in the Vicky-Jamal organ the more of a positive affect the whole body gets.
Financial concerns can reduce your responsibility to freeze, increasing the chance of you being froze, by allowing you to suggest that something in your environment is freeing you, represents freedom to you or is freely available for everyone. This changes telepathic connections by introducing unconscious deception, impersonal ultimatums such as asking someone about a situation only you experienced and the sense of irresponsibility towards the community based on the amount of currency they have so therefore the value they express for the things in the community.

Being happy about what’s happening can be mistaken for not wanting to freeze your community when the future is believed to be predetermined or available for everyone to influence. When you freeze someone you invalidate their influence in the community as you have taken into account the expectations or apprehension they have of their environment, so when they are no longer frozen they can continue to act in the way they desire or expect. This is similar to seeing freezing as an action, emotion or a form of influence, where the will is separated between the different intensities of force you can understand are being expressed creating a sense of being deceptive when a high intensity understanding is expressed with a low intensity one, such as interacting with an important person(high)and trying to make things look good(low) or feeling tired and continuing a habit. So you resist freezing as you’re believing someone with malicious intent will notice you beginning to freeze the community.
Claiming something, or some activity, is good enough to take up your time use your energy or limit your understanding of yourself or other activities suggests you have been trying to change your ideal, behaviour or relationships through freezing your community. This prevents you from being able to freeze as your ideal has you wanting to see an improvement, do something familiar or define a good interaction which is irrational to the extent that every time you believe you have no been able to freeze you are thinking that things are getting worse, you’re doing something completely new for everyone in your community or you’re confused about what to do after you freeze.
Believing you do not feel right, such as feeling to do something contrary to what you’d normally do, provides the sense of vision with the same understanding that you have of taste, that is the sense of contact being needed for taste to occur on your tongue for example, which confuses your responsibility to free with a desire of one of the gross (segregated into 5 categories) senses. These are a limited interpretation of what your body is sensing as it excludes the sense you have of your organs, deems immune responses as not sensible and suggests any addition sense can be reduced to one of the five. A need to freeze can arise when appreciating this limited interpretation as all categories can be satisfied by the understanding that you’re able to freeze everyone in your community but yourself. Allowing yourself to perceive your senses as innumerable, infinite or unlimited provides a sense of control over the sense you have of being able to freeze rather than a trying to control your organs or environment.

Attempting to freeze whilst thinking about people you know, therefore whilst supporting structure is developing, suggests that you cannot freeze everyone except yourself and so, if you do decide to freeze in this moment, will express negative emotions towards the memory. This negativity can be seen as ineffective or irrelevant if there’s an understanding of how the Vicky-Jamal organ is developing, such as whether it is providing pleasure to your most believed to be developing areas or not and how close it is to turning it’s sense into supporting structure, which invalidates the lack of understanding of why your environment would make you claim to be able to freeze when you’re not able to as you’d get a sense of what organs in your body have created an unequal interpretation of how your body works harmoniously, giving credit to one part of you as if you don’t have as much control over the other parts of your body. The negativity will lead you to not wanting to freeze anyone if you mistake your environment’s effect on your organs as suggesting that you need to focus, creating an interpretation of some personal importance, for the organ which will reduce your desire to make interpretations of other things in your community.
To desire, or presume, your reaction to or intention for your community is about another person, including being due to thoughts about another person, prevents the opportunity to freeze those in your environment without providing them with an understanding of their influence in the community that allows you to behave in this way, for example their appeal or attempt to appreciate the retarded scum in the community which promotes segregation of those participating in individuation in the community. Where an individual desires to provide interpretations of those who are retarding the community, if they view freezing as a negative experience inasmuch as losing control or reducing responsibility, they will be exclusively attracted to claiming they interpret the retarded scum as the more capable or excited about the community being freed, this includes seeing the interactions with them as more freeing, than people with significant individuality which confuses your community about what it’s purpose is or what it is doing as a community and therefore ways to be distinct and participate in individuation in the community.
Considering that someone’s intention to freeze their community must be verbalised creates the sense that claiming you can do something to someone reduces the conversation, interactions with and influence you have of or over them, this is due to the sense of uncertainty or lacking understanding that you may believe has arisen in their experience that is exclusively due to you telling them you can freeze the community they’re apart of. There is no possibility of any claim you make towards someone being the reason for them creating an experience of lacking understanding or asserting and thinking that you have confused them about their experience as the knowledge you have of your experience motivates you to what to freeze the community as they have claimed to you that the community appreciate their behaviour more then they appreciate the community and this supports your responsibility to freeze the community to the extent that you do not create distinctions between their behaviour and the community. Where you believe someone is considering or desires to create distinctions between the community and another’s behaviour you are actually imagining what it would be like if they were able to freeze the community, especially a circumstance where you are not frozen as they do so.

The ability to freeze the community and exclude some people from the freezing can be attributed to a mutual understanding of how the community can be froze and is mistakenly thought to be possible when you have a desire to free someone from the activities they’re apparent participating in, especially when the activity is retarding the community and only allows them to individuate by deceiving the community about their intentions or what they want from life whilst they perform the activity. 
To want to freeze when you are unsure how you feel produces the sense of novelty, unfamiliarity or convenience for those who are aware of the freezers intention to freeze the community. These sensations support the freezers responsibility to freeze those in his community, meaning everyone in the community except him, because they suggest to the individuals in the community that, excluding the freezer, everyone in the community is using the majority of their body, time or aspirations to participate in retardation, where the activity’s purpose is to provide the participant with a sense of superiority that cannot be transferred to those who are not participating as well, effect is creating the sense in the community that the activity provides more pleasurable benefits than any other activity and maintenance requires participants to believe they’re not completely in control or enthusiastic enough to determine how the activity affects them when it concludes.
Pitying someone or wanting to find out something special about them, especially if you believe you came up with the reason for doing so therefore think you are not being influenced by someone else to act in this way, suggests that you forgot how you feel when you are able, want or don’t have any desire to freeze those in your environment. Similarly to see yourself as representing the whole community, therefore everyone’s experience, opinions or feelings, prevents the sense that your desires or aspirations depend on what others in the community want or have already fulfilled. Freezing your environment becomes apparent to the extent that someone in the community believes, when they interact with their environment, that they consult or have an internal reality or sense of what they want from an external reality or situation. This suggests that the freezer, who doesn’t freeze themselves, rejects ideas that give them the sense of preference for some retarded scum, or scum-influenced behaviour, which is not a complement to the relationship they have with their foundational product, to the extent the person they made the bleach with accepts being associated with some retarded scum therefore proving the concentration of the bleach, or allows them to appreciate the typical interaction they have with the community and the generative principle being shown by the behaviour of what is in your community.

Believing you have to consider someone or something in your environment to think about your community suggests there’s a opportunity arising that you have previously rejected because you’re already satisfied enough by what you’ve done in the community or your understanding of the community. Similarly someone’s understanding of any activity can be degenerated, or reduced into a sense of certainty about what’s happening in your community, when habits are being maintained and a person believes there’s a difference in the benefit or pleasure of habitual behaviour and a novel behaviour.
The responsibility to freeze your community is delegated to the person with the most experience of participating in individuation because the possibility for you to freeze everyone in the community excluding yourself provides the opportunity, for the freezer, to invite others in the community to not be froze whilst everyone else is, therefore participating in individuation, where, if the freezer was some retarded scum, inviting some retarded scum into this process of individuation would lead them to abusing themselves and the community in their attempt to reject the interpretations giving to them by the freezer about why they’ve been chosen to participating in the individuation process in this way, therefore reinforcing their tendency to retard the community’s development, participating in retardation.
Forgetting what claims you’ve made to people in your community in the past suggests you are concerned about how property or currency is affected by a freeze of everyone in the environment, this represents desires to associate with retarded scum by suggesting their property or currency is the motivating or desirable factor that maintains your relationship with them which allows you to value what they claim, or think, whilst negatively reacting to their behaviour, therefore not letting them know what you think about their behaviour causing them to sense that you do not understand them, or what they’re doing. This sense in someone is mistaken for having forgotten something to the extent that this person is willing to form relationships which depend upon the impression you have of them.

Freezing everyone except those who have already been able to freeze everyone in the past is the most likely way in which a person’s first freezing will occur. This can be attributed to the sense of the community that someone has before they’re able to freeze the community, which is one where separate competitions are occurring at once rather than one phenomenon being developed, which can be seen as a single competition, freezing. The people that have already been able to freeze everyone will also appear to be frozen by the person who freezes everyone their first time when the first-time freezer believes they are considering who to unfreeze, whether they are affecting anyone in a way other than freezing them or is still entertained by the impressions they had of what it would be like when they freeze everyone before they did for their first time. It is physically impossible for someone to still be entertained by the impressions they had before their first freeze after they freeze for the second time and beyond because the continuation of the lives of people who are unable to freeze, and therefore have been frozen, suggests to the freezer that he has no influence over those he can freeze but chooses not to unfreeze whilst everyone is still frozen. The unfreezing of everyone can be seen as the responsibility of the freezer and everyone the freezer unfroze which is expressed as a establishing their ideals in the community.
Believing someone’s influence over you must relate to what you do together, what they’ve said or how you view them suggests neither of you are allowing the other to develop the responsibility to freeze your community which is done by figuring out who deserves the responsibility to freeze most. This is felt as a accidental or detrimental relationship when someone becomes intimate with someone with a responsibility to freeze, i.e. where the freezer unfreezes you whilst they have froze everyone who cannot freeze. The negativity for the freeze-resistant relationships can be mistaken for being a feeling for everyone in the community where you form freeze-resistant relationships in order to improve the intimacy of the relationship with the freezer, e.g. as you believe you can express the feeling you have for the freezer to those they will freeze, or to forgive and forget the behaviour of the freezer that you reacted negatively too, limiting the freezers responsibility to freeze.
Claiming that you do not expect any reward from what you do produces a sense of confusion about what it would feel like if you had a responsibility to freeze your community, including developing this responsibility and supporting the development in someone else. Similarly believing those who you’ve made telepathic connections with have not made connections with everyone in the community, i.e. your connection’s connection, etc..., suggests you want the people you regularly interact with to appreciate what you’re doing more than anyone else in the community, i.e. in a manner distinct from what everyone (who makes up and is the community itself) is already providing, rather than appreciating what they’re doing as they’re allowing you to frequently influence them.
To reference a machine for it’s individual abilities suggests, firstly that the machine is not in their possession and secondly, the ability to freeze is restricted to the recipient end of a person’s relationship with a computer. This is similar to uncertainty arising about the consensus of unfreezing as a machine has no ability to detract or obfuscate consensual behaviour.

Freeze is irrational to the extent that every time you believe you have no been able to freeze you are thinking that things are getting worse, you’re doing something completely new for everyone in your community or you’re confused about what to do after you freeze.
Freeze is rational to the extent that when you know you wanted freeze in the medical reality you believe things are getting better, you’re doing something people will recognise as familiar and normal for you or you have a plan for what to do during freeze.
The Vicky-Jamal organ’s activity and function is mistaken for the brain’s when someone has little understanding of the interactions of their body with nano technologies, which are made up of materials your body need not reject because they can be assimilated by the immune system, because their interactions with their environment create distinctive interpretations of their personality in different parts of the community which are associated or understood with the brains stress-mediating function rather than the pleasure-sense alternating or oscillating function of the Vicky-Jamal organ.

Freezing is different from arresting as the former implies the latter, not vice versa, because the freezer can stop people from being froze by removing its influence. When the arrested removes their influence from the arrested there’s no affect in the community because the arrested is under arrest; in other words arresting someone prevents them from ever being able to arrest where freezing someone suggests they will one day be able to freeze considering the fact they’d be unfroze and recommending a freezer to someone to in accordance with the evolving quality of a freeze.
Freezing is different from watching as the former creates affects that the latter cannot. The watcher can watch someone without them knowing they’re being watched and similarly watching someone does not affect their ability to watch anything. On the other hand, whoever is being froze by a freezer will know they are freezing and similarly the more froze someone is determines the extent they can affect how many people can freeze in the community negatively because they can only freeze further people who are less froze than them; when someone is being watched they can only watch, or determine someone’s ability to be watching, those who are being watched more than them, which is limited/invalidated (with little to no affect) as the people watching them can determine how they affect other’s ability to watch.
Freezing is distinct from the sense of touch because the latter creates the responsibility for the former. Where someone feels like the circumstances they’ve experienced within the community are more important than someone else, and they have proved this to the same other person, they can develop their responsibility to freeze them by offering to another a means of participating in the circumstances that they deem significantly important and when the other rejects or misunderstands this offer they have been froze which grants the offerer the potential to freeze them, and all of those within the community that the person who felt like rejecting the offer is influenced by as their relationship has determined their decision to not participate in what the offer involves in the future because of their sense of what’s physically possible which has limited their responsibility to feel what others around them believe is important.
Freezing is similar to shouting because not only does the latter often leads to the former but someone who shouts can also cease most muscle movement, freezing almost entirely. What’s left of the feeling to shout something is usually a pause as well, so with these two options of freeze-shout correlation (fsc) a third would have to be related to the first and second fsc in the same way freeze=>watching=>sensing are.
