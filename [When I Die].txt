[When I Die]

As we all praise Psychoanalysis, we need to create a greater adversary than Satan.
To reach those who do not know Jesus. 
All of my parents forsook this adversary.
Satan is infinitely, dreadfully or irrationally worse than an adversary, in regards to individuals losing care, control or sense of their body and mind. This makes it necessary for melancholy, revenge or conflict to be conceived as being cause by the imposition of an individuals saver. Saving only what maintains suffering for the individual.

Literally speaking, Satan protects all individual beings from embodying the energy of homosexuality, similarly the Best Born God protects us all from embodying the energy of heterosexuality.

Stupid people defacate as they cannot cope with or understand that technology would function better if it could know exactly where we are, including the exact structure of our body, suggesting facilities like toilets would evolve to be oriented in direct regard to our excreting organs’ orifices.

A certain pair of individuals, who have been married to each other would like others to think they got together because the husband asked for the wife’s hand in marriage. After this a period of time elapsed, as the husband only requested that they would get married some day, here I am uncertain of her approval; I suppose she waited sufficiently from his perspective and this wait would be the same purgatory people believe they wait for When They Die.
When I Die I would be going to the place the most miserable people in my world would be going to When They Die.
