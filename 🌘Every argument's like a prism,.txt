ðŸŒ˜Every argument's like a prism,
I'm in prison,
Since we're the same at both ends,
We can amend,
If I try and tell them,
They pretend,

Put my foot halfway through their door,
They want more,
Push my foot all the way down to the floor,
I'll move more,

Making sense out of the suspense,
My intelligence in priceless, but I'll trade my dignity for a few pence,

I tried saving a street worker,
She became a twerker,
And a tweeter,
At least now her life is neater,
But now all my friends what to meet her,
I hear they hear she has that 'woman worth'

It's not something that she wears,
It's just how she wears her skirts,
Try to make the best out of our convos,
'But anything other than sex is long tho',

Try to make the best out of your respect,
But all you do is laugh at my jokes and cook for me,
I mean that's stuff's nice, but by the time I'm 40,
It'll be old, and I'll be three quarters of the way done, 
And I just want more fun,

How can you find it hard to tell a guy you love him,
When you know when he says it to you,
He means nothing,
That's gotta mean something,

If I can keep you happy forever,
While fucking your sister,
I can keep two people happy forever,
And die more fulfilled,

My motto is that I should be allowed to live abnormally,
Because then I'm closer to being supernatural,
Which means I haven't got to pay attention to the factual,
In fact, though I agree with mostly everything I heard,
I'm just waiting for the day when I hear something, I've never heard,ðŸŒ’
