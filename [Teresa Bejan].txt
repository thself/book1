I understand this/that/everything.
I do not understand this/that/everything.
Everything/that/this is amazing.

This/that/everything is my agenda or way of living/being/perceiving.
I do not know/care about that/this/every agenda or way of living/being/perceiving.
I can handle what this/that/every way of living/being/perceiving knows/cares about.

I’m treating this/that/everything like it is appearing on a television.
I hate this/that/everything like it is appearing on a television, I don’t expect/imagine it to realise I despise it and want to destroy everything it knows/cares about.
I will reject/hate/hurt myself if this/that/everything prevents me from interacting by/with what I know/care about.

When people think of each other, is the telekinetic affect cutting them up, or massaging them? They both have a firm grip but the former with/by a sharp/dangerous load and the latter with/by a tender load of similar material(skin, to the hands).
When someone has no experience of massaging someone telekinetically, you think of them negatively, as retarded scum or needing to be cut up (in order to reduce the affect of their thoughts of others which cut them up).
When I think about this/that/everything I cut myself up, so I should think about how I am as an individual.

I think I can make/get this/that/everything exactly/perfectly correct when I believe I do not care/know what it is/means.
As this/that/everything has a way of making/getting it with/by perfection/exaction the movements within it can avoid the theory of Passionate Attraction(Elementary Listype).
This/that/everything helps to develop the theory of Passionate Attraction if you know/care about how it treats the community and what it’s existence is/means.

Going against, deceiving or resisting movements that are avoiding the theory of Passionate Attraction allows you to make/get this/that/everything mean/be the thing you care/know about the most.
Developing the theory of Passionate Attraction is mistaken for asserting yourself, moving forward or letting go and detaching when this/that/everything seems to need time or space,I.e. distinctions, in order to be/mean something perfectly/exactly in accord with/by your ideals.
Interpreting, ignoring or creating information for someone provides means to regenerate, immortalise or reinforce the parts or perspectives of your personality that know/care about the interaction provided. This happens because of and during the consequent appreciation of your behaviour.

Appreciation is represented by/with the invalidation or interpretation of experiences where someone believes they’ve remembered something they’ve forgotten, are performing poorly due to a lack of memory or are remembering that they forgot something (e.g. what they are doing or what something means to them). When appreciation is seen as anything else, your experience has been reduced to a thought, belief or sensationalising process(such as pondering, wondering or being amazed) where only the sense of forgetting something is seen as beneficial and pleasurable and the revival of the meaning or content of something is reacted to unconsciously by/with a sense of reward or a sense of enjoyment.
Someone’s interactions with/by this/that/everything are what makes/gets them their sense of being/meaning for future circumstances, which suggests that they know/care about the developments happening in the community that they are interacting with/by.
Claiming you are not enjoying or benefiting from this/that/everything can lead to repetitive or destructive experiences when you do not mean/care what you say to someone. This happens whilst you remember the claim you made, when someone talks to you about the claim you made or when you think you did not get/make a claim about how you felt.

I enjoy when people think that/this/everything can make/get you selfish.
I do not know/care about what I think I reject/hate/hurt because I cannot enjoy what it becomes/means after I experience it. I enjoy rejecting/hating/hurting this/that/everything if I can get/make it in any manner I want.
I reject/hate/hurt my position in the community, claiming I do not know where I am and that I do not want to be in this/that/any place, as I know/care that television displays various perspectives/programs.

Televisions that concern/inform you about this/that/everything distort your understanding of straightness or consistency and corners or change in order to prevent your amount of knowledge/care about your responsibilities from supporting your individuality, being expressed in accord with/by your individuality and determining the sense of your individuality from developing.
Reacting to protect, enjoy or understand yourself whilst watching television gets/makes this/that/everything support you in a process of retardation. This happens as the images displayed on the television prevent/limit your senses meaning/becoming supporting structure which reinforces behaviour such as appreciating, asserting and obeying which function to provide the people surrounding you in your environment to either get a sense of your individuality or critique, therefore interpreting, your individuality (which if you display any retarded scum behaviour gives you the opportunity to individuate encouraging you to interpret the situations you have desires to retard).
Your manner/way/impression of watching television determines whether you are displayed upon a television and the affect of your body/individuality has on those who watch you on a television. The chance of someone wanting you to be displayed upon their television represents their sense of control or influence/significance over you where your individuality is understood as not being able to interpret when they want to participate in a process of retardation, meaning/because they benefit from the enjoyment they get from hating/hurting/rejecting themselves when you attempt to express your individuality when they are near you.

Whenever I know/care about something in my environment I am being retarded, deceived or amused by/with the people who also interact with/by the same thing in my environment which means/is when I reject/hate/hurt myself I am considering to interact with/by this thing, e.g. hating myself as I go to play a multiplayer game or rejecting myself before I use an online platform.
To hate/hurt/reject this/that/everything means/is when someone cannot accept another’s body/individuality so they reduce their understanding of another’s body to a need to be informed/concerned by/with a specific part of another’s body, ignoring the function of different, unspecified body parts.
Hating/hurting/rejecting this/that/everything when you believe you have utilised/conceptualised/proved an image displayed on television’s potential to be expressed as your individuality suggests you program/respect this/that/everything expecting to understand how to be happier, experiencing more pleasurable benefits or being influenced/signified by/with people less. This is because there’s no interaction someone has with/by their environment that cannot be used at a later time to prevent them from understanding this/that/everything.

This/that/everything is displayed upon a television so I cannot forget how to establish what I know/care about in the community’s meaning/behaviour. This is because programs/perspectives cannot stop existing rather this/that/everything moves slower therefore becoming a less significant/influential program/perspective.
This/that/everything represents a newly created program/perspective when this/that/everything becomes/means the initiation/innovation of a theory.
When this/that/everything supports the development of the theory of Passionate Attraction it functions as bleach. Here the foundational product is the sense of distinction, uniqueness or novelty; the typical interaction is between things you remember and this/that/everything; the generative principle determines what this/that/everything means/is because the theory of Passionate Attraction respects/programs someone’s sense of what’s possible.

A perspective/program is the responsibility someone has for how this/that/everything develops from, invalidates or coexists with/by meaning/being hated/hurt/rejected.
Interpreting, labelling or changing your sense of the perspectives/programming you have prevents you from intimately/influentially being/meaning to develop your body/individuality. This occurs because perspectives/programs do not influence/signify someone’s senses and are rather a way understanding is expressed through the senses, where a sense of lacking understanding represents the perspective/program of people who you are intimate/influenced by/with.
Believing you can perceive/program television in any way you want, only in positive ways or in a way that makes/gets you to appreciate yourself more suggests you do not understand why people who are not intimate/influencing with/by you behave the way they do. This is because you are telekinetically manipulating them to convince you that being intimate/influenced by/with you prevents you from participating in activities, understanding other’s interpretations or being appreciated by/with the community.
The extent that a television influences/intimidates someone is proportional to their tendency to deceive, hate/hurt/reject or copy another’s behaviour, believing there is no possibility of this having a negative affect or confusing them about their desires of the experience. This is because the relationship has been reduced to a fraction of the interactions where neither of the people were interested in what the other had to offer, what effect they have on the community or how the other enjoys the opportunities provided by them due to what is displayed on a television.
Everything/this/that is displayed on television in order or derivation of the programs content or self esteem, in other words there’s intimate/influential descriptions of someone’s sense processors or creating organs (mechanisms) within the projected images someone has of their environment.

Being shown that impacts of family violence were provided through the atonement of Jesus Christ, in our ability to have faith in him and the agency that follows, suggests that Joseph Smith’s translations complement Charles Fourier’s passions.
